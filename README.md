## Requirements

* The project should have a nice graphical user interface (meh).
* There should be a `replay` button to restart the game when finished.
* The game should look, feel and work similarly in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
* The project can't contain any errors, warnings or notices in the developer console.
